# Read Me - PingPal Android Messenger

## Summary
This repository is for the Android version of the PingPal Messenger application. This project is an eclipse project.

## Description
PingPal messenger is a privacy protected group chat app with a positioning twist.
Connect with your Facebook friends and chat one-on-one or in groups.

But the best part is that you can check where they are right now. No tracking, just ask and answer. 
We call that you "Ping" them. You can even have the app answer automatically where you are, 
and that's a good thing when you for instance lost someone and they don't answer their phone. 
You can even Ping a group of friends if you're out partying or skiing and get separated from them. 
No tracking or stalking! You are in control over who can ping you!

PingPal Messenger is built upon the Apptimate Secure Communication and Positioning as a Service platform,
where no data is stored on their servers, only in your and your friends phones. 
No central data that can be hacked and leaked!
